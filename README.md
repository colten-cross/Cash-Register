# Python---CashRegister

This program simulates a cash register transaction by generating a random dollar amount for an order, taking in input for how much cash the customer gives,
and then gives the amount of change that the employee needs to give back to the customer. 

The neat thing about this program is that it does not only give the amount of change that needs to be returned, but breaks it down completely by units of 
currency. It provides the employee with the exact amount of dollar bills, quarters, dimes, etc. that need to be given back. 

I wrote this program to practice using several functions and return statements together to better organize my code, rather than writing linear code. 

This program is currently all ran in the command line, but for a future update I will create a cash register style GUI that the employee can use.
